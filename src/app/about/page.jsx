        Three Idiots is my favourite film. This is the story of three Imperial
        College of Engineering engineering students who discover their
        relationship by making themselves look like idiots and learning from it.
        Farhan Qureshi, played by R. Madhavan, Raju Rastogi, played by Sharman
        Joshi, and Ranchoddas Shamaldas “Rancho” Chanchad, played by Aamir Khan,
        were the key characters. The major reason I enjoy this picture is that,
        although being a comedy, it has a message and it is about mankind. Aside
        from that, I enjoy this film since it offers information about our
        educational system.

        This film has had a huge impact on me, especially the statement "All is
        well" that Rancho constantly says. I think that whatever conditions may
        arise if any obstacles arise, I will simply state this and remain cool
        because I believe that every problem must have a solution.
